##Â Installing SIP
The Sight Input Processor provides in depth debug capabilites while developing for EyesDrive. By connecting EyesDrive to SIP, the eye position can be visualized in real time along with connection statistics, live EOG plots and calibration values.

SIP could be also used in legacy codebases that would require major code changes to integrate them with EyesDrive by simulating keystrokes. To integrate your application via SIP, please see (Integrating your application with SIP)[#sip]

Open a new terminal window and paste the following command to install SIP:
```
pip install eyesdrive-sip
```
